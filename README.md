This contains details about the project - What did you do, How did you do and any other relevant information that would be necessary for evaluators to judge your work.

This project was created as part of INSAID Capstone project to help HR advisories to help detect possible employees leaving the organization.  The data was sourced from the company's HRMS system where the details of past and current employees are available for the past 20 years.

In this project, we will evaluate and conclude whether an employee is likely to leave the organization or not.
